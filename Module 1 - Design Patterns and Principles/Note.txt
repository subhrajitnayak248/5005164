 SOLID PRINCIPLES
  - S : Single Pesponsibility Principle (SRP)
  - O : Open Closed Principle (OCP)
  - L : Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
  - I : Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
  - D : Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 SRP :
  - A Class should have one and only one reason to change
 
 OCP :
  - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
 
 LSP :
  - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types

 ISP :
  - The Dependency of one class to another one should depend on the smallest possible
    Interface
  - Clients shouldn't be forced to implement interfaces they don't use
  - Instead of one fat interface many small interfaces are preferred based on groups
    of methods, each one serving one sub-module
 
 DIP :
  - Depend upon abstractions (interfaces) not upon concrete classes
